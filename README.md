# RadChat

Prototype of an AI-assisted speech-to-text app for Aphasia patients.

Functionality:

1. Tapping on the microphone starts recording audio
2. Tapping o the stop button stops the recording
3. The recorded speech is processed by a LLM to paraphrase and correct errors if necessary
4. The result can be played as audio or shared with a share button
